## Event Driven Architecture

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Have you ever wondered what [ReactPHP](http://reactphp.org/) meant by "non blocking I/O"? Or why would being "event-driven" allow [nginx to be more efficient than Apache](https://www.nginx.com/blog/nginx-vs-apache-our-view/)?
  
  If you find it easier to understand abstract concepts like these by implementing them, then you're in luck because in this talk we'll create a simple HTTP server, then develop an event loop and finally create a simple Promise class.

  Once we're done, we'll have all the tools at our disposal to make our
  [Symfony applications as performant as NodeJs ones](https://gnugat.github.io/2016/04/13/super-speed-sf-react-php.html)!
